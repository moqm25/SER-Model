# SER Model

A Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model is a system that uses machine learning techniques to automatically recognize emotions in speech signals. It typically involves extracting relevant features from speech signals and training a classifier to recognize emotions based on those features. The goal of an SER model is to accurately identify the emotional state of the speaker based on their speech.
